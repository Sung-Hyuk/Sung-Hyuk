Hello, I'm Mr. Sung-Hyuk Kwon from South Korea, currently staying in Korea. 

Incoming English-Korean Localization / Functional Game Tester at Activision Blizzard (Aug 2022-Aug 2023, Ireland), Loc-pros & Test IO (Freelance test & localization companies)

Seeking relevant on/offline jobs. Have English-Korean translator, graphic design, and the United Nations career in Switzerland and Tunisia.

Trusted as a ‘go-to QA tester’ who excels in anything he puts his mind to and handles any situations with multi-priorities under pressure.
Clients appreciate my eyes for detail from graphic design work, persistence, voluntary extra work, ability to meet deadlines, and sense of humor.

Skills:
- All genres of Mobile/PC/console game English-Korean localization testing (audio/video file, text, graphic)
- Finding and reporting bugs, glitches, crashes, missing textures, and quests not working
- Report editing and proofreading

Learning:
Testing tools (Bugzilla, Jira, etc), test case writing, app testing, game design, and game development

Motivation:
I’ll assure my games’ best quality by creating high-quality bug reports, screenshots, and videos as I got a training of digital content production and prepared lots of reporting materials at the United Nations and Master’s in international studies. I’ll always approach users’ different ways of playing games and what they need from their experiences with my games and give quick/creative feedback on localization quality respecting cultural nuances, what I like/don’t like about games, level suitability, quest play/enjoy-ability, and any aspects to be improved smoothly working with other teams.
